"To the _innovation station_!"
=======================

Although we’re serious about what we do, this phrase is used more tongue-in-cheek than anything.

Ask our peers in the DevOps team what we do, and we get a lot of blank stares and blinky eyes. Truth be told, it was fairly time-consuming for us at first to define exactly what that is. We knew what we were doing, but finding a way to articulate it to our peers can sometimes prove to be challenging.

Buzz-words are plentiful, and it seems as though people like to use them.

Now, we’re lean, mean, innovation machines.
LOL

Or should I say “Buyologists?”
